# Movie-and-TV-Search-Website
This app is an assignment for our CS499 Advanced Web Development class. In this app a user will be able to search for a movie or tv show and find information on their search. Users can find out basic information about the query: year, date it was released, rating, runtime, genre, director and writers. They can also see the plot, the awards it won, and an image of the poster.
